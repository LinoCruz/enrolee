# Enrolee

Enrolee is a project made with Python-Flask, that provides a simple way for students, faculty and staff to register for classes, conferences, workshops, lectures, study groups, and more. Students can search for courses, find out what they are enrolled in, sign up for them, and pay for them using their existing student accounts. Faculty and staff can create new events, invite students to participate, and track registrations.
